This document specifies the process to create and manage "Guardian Process Description(s) (GPDs)."

Author: Tim Bansemer
Status: Draft
Date: 15 April 2024

The GPDs define every process related to the Guardian and its capabilities in an implementation independent description.
A GPD is numbered and progresses through three stages: Draft, Reviewed, and Final.

Draft:
The GPD is proposed to be discussed within the team to serve as a framework for requirements and specifications.

Reviewed:
The GPD has been internally reviewed by the team; everyone is informed about the purpose of the process and understands why an implementation is required.

Final:
For a GPD to be final, the following conditions must be met:
The architecture has been reviewed by external subject matter experts.
There is a running implementation of the process.
There is an automated test script according to the process requirements. This ensures that there are no degradations in future iterations of the process implementation. With a successful implementation and testing, we have proven that the process and specifications can be matched and are therefore mature.
